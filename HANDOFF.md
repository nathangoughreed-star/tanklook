# TankLook (aquarium visualizer): handoff

Living file. Project state and dated decisions go here; update in place.

## Status (2026-10-08)

Phase 1 proof of concept: done and accepted. Kept at `reference/aquarium-poc.html` (reference only).

**Phase 2 build: done locally, not yet deployed.** Vite + TypeScript project at the repo root (see README.md for
layout). Verified: `npm test` 24/24 (perspective ratio = d/(d+z) straight on, same pixel size across tank depths,
zoom never moves the eye, glass table, bilinear substrate, v1→v2 migration, clamping, undo coalescing, storage);
`npm run build` clean; production build exercised in the browser: add, drag, undo/redo (buttons + Ctrl+Z/Shift+Z),
compare + LED lighting, orbit, PNG 2× export, JSON save/open, bad-file rejection, autosave + restore on reload,
375 px phone layout with no sideways scroll.

Shipped features: species search (common/scientific, accent-insensitive), add / add school / drag / duplicate /
flip / delete / delete-all (armed), save/load (localStorage autosave + JSON file), PNG export 1×/2×/4×, undo/redo
(200 steps; slider and pointer drags coalesce into one step; camera moves are saved but not undoable), interior
volume readout, more tank presets.

Next: **create the public GitHub repo, first commit + push, enable Pages (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub
Actions)**, then check the live URL.
**Domain: tanklook.com** (bought by Nathan 2026-10-08, 1 year; personal learning project).
`public/CNAME` = tanklook.com is in place. Remaining: create the repo, push, set Pages Source to GitHub
Actions, then at the registrar add A records for @ (185.199.108.153 / .109 / .110 / .111) and CNAME www ->
<username>.github.io, then set the custom domain in Pages and enforce HTTPS. git and Node are installed; `gh` is not, so Nathan creates the empty repo.

## Decisions made (2026-10-08)

- **Rendering: Three.js, fish as flat textured cards ("planes") in a simple 3D box tank.** Not a 2D canvas with
  hand-rolled projection, and not Konva. Reason: perspective, occlusion, camera moves, picking and export come free;
  the custom-2D route re-implements a mini 3D engine.
- **Perspective rule:** the eye is a fixed physical distance from the front glass (default 1200 mm), the same for every
  tank; zoom only changes field of view (crop), never perspective. Comparison view uses one FOV for both tanks so pixel
  sizes are directly comparable. Verified: measured on-screen ratio = d / (d + z) exactly, straight-on.
- **Units:** all scene data in mm. Coordinates: x along length 0..L, y up 0..H, depth z = mm behind the front glass
  (three.js z = -depth). Tank L/H/D are **interior** dimensions; glass is added outside.
- **Scene data is the source of truth**, serialisable JSON with a `version` field; the renderer rebuilds from it.
- **Card edges:** alpha-test cutouts (hard silhouettes). Art rule: clean outlines, transparent background, no soft glows
  or baked shadows. Alpha-to-coverage is the smoother option.
- **Camera:** free orbit by dragging empty space (pivot = tank centre, radius chosen so straight-on eye distance is exact).
  Proposed release limits still ±30° left/right, 0-25° from above (sliders flag beyond). Not yet decided whether to enforce.
- **Fish drag plane follows the view:** front-ish = parallel to glass; >45° from above = floor plan (sets depth);
  side-on = side plane.
- **Substrate:** four corner depths, bilinear surface, physical thickness (not scaled between tanks), mm-sized grain;
  anti-tiling = two rotated texture samples blended by value noise + soft brightness patches.
- **Glass:** auto thickness by interior height (<=13" 5 mm, <=17" 6, <=21" 8, <=25" 10, <=30" 12, else 15); standard
  (green edge) or low-iron. Rimmed / rimless.
- **Lighting:** custom shader injection into MeshBasicMaterial (not three.js lights; those leave edge-on cards black).
  Emitters above water: spot (cone), tube (line segment), LED array (grid). Normalised so every fixture type has the
  same mean brightness at mid-height; colour temperature via Kelvin to RGB at unit luminance; room-light ambient.
  Cards take the light level at their position (no facing term). Saturation lift 1.35 on cards, hue-preserving clamp.
- **Hosting goal (Nathan, 2026-10-08):** a publicly hosted website.
- **Phase 2 stack (Nathan, 2026-10-08):** Vite + plain TypeScript (no React); GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions;
  **public** repo. Only procedural placeholder art is committed until the art provenance policy is settled.

## Still open

Juvenile/custom sizes; release camera limits; species list for beta (25-30); art pipeline + provenance policy;
whether lighting ships in v1; hardscape scope; React vs plain TS for the UI layer (see Phase 2 plan).

## Phase 2 build decisions (2026-10-08)

- Scene format v2: `glass` is `'auto' | number` (v1 stored a string); `edge` is `cutout | a2c` (the PoC's "soft"
  demo mode was dropped and migrates to cutout); added `name`. Unknown species are skipped on load with a warning.
- One `Store` owns scene + selection + history; every mutation goes through `store.update()`. UI re-syncs all
  controls from the scene on every change (one `sync()`), so undo, file open and pointer drags refresh identically.
- Readout is computed right after the synchronous draw (fixes the PoC's one-frame lag).
- Lighting in compare view: checked, works (uniforms are set per viewport before each render).
- Removed PoC test aids: depth ladder, "what to test" list. Kept the perspective readout (it is the proof).
- Autosave key `tanklook.scene` in localStorage, debounced 400 ms and flushed on `pagehide`.
- **Room + lid (Nathan, 2026-10-08), scene v3** (v2 files load with these off/open):
  - `stand {show, height 12-48 in (default 30), finish black|white|oak}`: same footprint as the outer glass, from the
    floor up to the tank underside (`tankUnderside()` / `floorY()` in physics.ts).
  - `wall {show, side back|left|right, color}`: room wall 50 mm off the glass; left/right = peninsula. One-sided, so
    it vanishes when orbiting behind it. A plain floor is drawn whenever stand or wall is on.
  - `lid open|glass|hood`: glass = two 4 mm panels + hinge strip (on the rim lip, or on the panes if rimless);
    hood = low-profile moulded lid (38 mm back, 22 mm rounded front, feeding hatch) after Nathan's reference photo;
    with a hood the light fixture is not drawn (it is inside) but its light still applies.
  - `person {show, height 0.9-2.1 m (default 1.75), side left|right}`: neutral flat silhouette for scale, standing on
    the floor 250 mm beside the tank at mid-depth; turns to face the viewer (billboard about the vertical axis).
    Placeholder art, same pipeline as the fish cards.
- **Framing:** bounds now include the stand; the image window is shifted (lens shift via `setViewOffset`) so the
  bounds are centred. Eye point unchanged, so perspective and the d/(d+z) rule hold (tested). The shift fades as
  zoom rises (`offset / zoom`), so zooming closes on the tank, not the cabinet.
- **Glass edges:** every pane gets an outline (light on dark backgrounds, dark on light); low-iron edge tint made
  stronger. Thin glass edge faces are sub-pixel, outlines are always at least 1 px.
- Checked, not a bug: from steep angles the black top rim hides a strip of the interior behind the front glass
  (pixel readback confirmed the sightline passes through the rim).
- **Single-file build (Nathan, 2026-10-08):** `npm run build:single` -> `dist-single/tanklook.html` (~560 kB), made by
  `scripts/build-single.mjs`, which inlines dist/'s script and CSS (no plugin). Opens from disk with no install;
  verified self-contained (served alone: one request, no errors). Gitignored; attach or share the file.
- Dev server exposes `window.__gb = {store, viewer}` for debugging (dev only, not in the production build).
- Bundle is ~520 kB (137 kB gzip), almost all three.js. Fine for now.

## Phase 2 plan (approved 2026-10-08, built as above)

1. Repo + hosting skeleton first: Vite + TypeScript, GitHub repo, auto-deploy (GitHub Pages or Vercel/Netlify).
   Deploy a "hello tank" on day one so hosting risk is retired early.
2. Port the PoC into modules: `scene/` (types + JSON versioning + validation), `render/` (tank, substrate, glass,
   lighting shader, cards), `interact/` (pick, drag, orbit), `ui/` (panels), `data/species.json`.
3. Then the Phase 2 feature list from the original spec: species search, add/drag/duplicate/delete, save/load
   (localStorage + JSON file), PNG export, undo/redo.
Each module is a separable unit, so subagents can build in parallel once the types in `scene/` exist.

## Known gaps

- Placeholder fish art; only three species until the beta species list and art provenance policy are decided.
- One sample plant card (hardscape/plants scope still open).
- Scene rebuilds fully on every change, including each drag step; fine at hundreds of fish, revisit if schools get big.
